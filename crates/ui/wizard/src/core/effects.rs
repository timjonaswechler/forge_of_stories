/*!
Core effect & task model (Phase 10 / groundwork for Executor + Phase 11 Intent split)

This module consolidates the effect system introduced incrementally in earlier
phases (initially prototyped inside `core::reducer`). It will become the single
source of truth for:

- Effect enum (declarative side‑effect descriptions)
- TaskKind enum (asynchronous / long‑running or IO bound work units)
- Future: TaskResult / InternalEvent mapping
- Helper constructors & utilities

Temporary State:
Currently `Effect` and `TaskKind` are still also defined inside `core::reducer`.
After adding this file, the next step is to:
  1. Remove the duplicate definitions from `core::reducer`
  2. Adjust imports there and in `core::loop` to use `crate::core::effects::*`

Doing it in two steps keeps this change isolated (safer incremental commit).

Design Principles:
- Reducer stays pure: it only returns `Vec<Effect>`
- Event loop (or a dedicated TaskExecutor) interprets `Effect::Async(TaskKind)` and spawns tasks
- Completion of tasks re-enters the system as an Action / InternalEvent (migration coming in Phase 11)
- Effect variants are intentionally minimal & additive

Planned Extensions:
- Effect::Batch(Vec<Effect>) for atomic grouping
- TaskKind variants for: PreflightRefresh, PersistSettings, FetchHealthStatus
- Result channel: TaskResultKind + mapping to InternalEvent enum (post Intent/Action split)
- Telemetry hooks & structured logging wrappers
