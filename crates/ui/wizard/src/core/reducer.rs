//! Reducer Prototype (Phase 4.2)
//!
//! This module introduces an initial, minimalist reducer function operating
//! solely on the high-level `RootState` (see `core/state.rs`). The goal is to
//! begin centralizing state transitions triggered by user/system "intents"
//! (currently aliased to the existing `Action` enum via `intent.rs`).
//!
//! Scope (Phase 4.2):
//!   * Handle a small subset of intents: Quit, Navigate, Resize
//!   * Mutate only `RootState`; do NOT yet alter `WizardApp` fields directly
//!   * Prepare ground for future effect handling by returning a `Vec<Effect>`
//!
//! Non-goals (for now):
//!   * No side-effects (I/O, async tasks)
//!   * No direct changes to `WizardApp` (integration will follow incrementally)
//!   * No focus management (will be added in Phase 4.3)
//!
//! Integration Strategy:
//!   - The event loop (AppLoop) will call `reduce(&mut app.root_state, intent)`
//!     before (or instead of) mutating `WizardApp` directly for the handled intents.
//!   - A small adapter layer (to be written) can then reconcile `RootState` flags
//!     (`quit_requested`, `pending_navigation`) back into the legacy page system
//!     until that system is deprecated.
//!
//! Navigation Mapping (temporary):
//!   * We map `Navigate(usize)` indices heuristically to semantic `AppState`
//!     variants to demonstrate state machine progression.
//!     - 0 => Setup
//!     - 1 => Settings
//!     - 2 => Dashboard
//!     - 3 => Health
//!     - >=4 => Dashboard (default fallback)
//!
//! Future Enhancements:
//!   * Introduce a distinct `Intent` enum diverging from `Action`
//!   * Add effect enumeration (`Effect::{Log, Async(TaskKind), ...}`)
//!   * Fold focus & popup routing into reducer
//!   * Replace index-based navigation with explicit semantic intents
//!
//! Testing:
//!   * See unit tests at bottom verifying each handled intent mutation.
//!
//! NOTE: This file is additive and does not remove or break existing logic.
//!       The legacy imperative updates inside the loop will be gradually
//!       replaced by reducer-driven state transitions.
